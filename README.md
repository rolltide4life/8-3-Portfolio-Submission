# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Event Tracker program is designed to effectively manage a database of past and upcoming events. Users can easily add or remove entries, with personalized access to their accounts for secure management. If you don’t have an account, you can conveniently sign up from the login screen. The main interface showcases an organized list of upcoming events, while dedicated screens are available for adding and updating event details. I've conducted thorough research on similar apps to identify the best features, ensuring the Event Tracker offers an intuitive user experience.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The application is designed with three distinct screens to enhance user navigation: the dates screen, the view dates screen, and the setup or login screen, which varies based on the user's status as a new or returning member. Each screen is thoughtfully crafted with a user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can easily access and interact with the features. The intuitive design prioritizes user experience, making it simple for everyone to navigate through the application seamlessly.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached the coding process by carefully analyzing and understanding the specific requirements and desires of the user. My main objective was to design an application that was intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that anyone could navigate it with little to no training. To minimize the potential for errors, I created a comprehensive checklist outlining all the features and components I planned to implement. Adhering to this list not only kept me organized but also helped maintain my focus throughout the development process. These strategies formed the backbone of my approach, allowing me to create a seamless experience for the user.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
This procedure is vital as it provides a structured approach to identifying potential errors that may go unnoticed if you were to proceed without a clear plan. By following this method, you can carefully analyze each step, allowing you to catch mistakes early and prevent complications down the line.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I faced a series of challenges while working on this project. As I delved deeper, it became clear that my initial approach was overly ambitious, leading to unnecessary complications. After some reflection, I recognized that at its core, a calendar is a straightforward tool. Embracing simplicity can often yield the best results. By narrowing it down to just three screens, I believe the design achieves a more streamlined and aesthetically pleasing look, making it much more user-friendly and efficient.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
In my opinion, the user interface was the most straightforward aspect to complete. I found it intuitive and user-friendly, which made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. I didn’t encounter any difficulties, allowing me to navigate through the various features with ease and confidence.
